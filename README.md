This project is purely for fun, I've been wanting to throw together a few different libraries and frameworks into a Movie Quotes Chat Application.

I will refine this project overtime, below are the key things I want to incorporate:

* SERVER: Node / Express
* LIBS: Socket.IO or ES6 Observables (PUB/SUB pattern)
* CLIENT: React or Aurelia or Vue
* BUNDLER/TRANSPILER: Webpack / Babel
* TESTS: Mocha/Chai probably some automated tests too (pffff)

This readme will be updated properly in due course.
